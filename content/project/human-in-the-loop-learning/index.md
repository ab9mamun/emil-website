title: Human-in-the-Loop Learning
summary: Designing active learning strategies that collect labeled sensor data
  in uncontrolled environments is challenging because (i) without taking into
  account user's cognitive factors, active learning places much burden on the
  user and lowers adoption of the technology; and (ii) the labels expressed by
  end-users exhibit significant amounts of temporal and spacial variations
  leading to poor performance of the learned models. In this project, we design,
  develop, and validate human-in-the-loop technologies that collect sensor data
  in-the-wild and develop algorithms and tools (i) to maximize the active
  learning performance taking informativeness of sensor data, burden of data
  labeling on user, and reliability of prospective labels into account; and (ii)
  for understanding and inferring complex health events using wearable and
  mobile sensors.

# User Studies:
## Human-in-the-Loop Data Collection Using Wearable Sensors and Mobile Devices for Machine Learning Algorithm Design
This research study aims to collect sensor data that will be used to develop machine learning algorithms. We want to collect data from a set of typical activities of daily living. The data collected in this study will be fully de-identified. You are being asked to take part because you are eligible to participate in this experiment. You will be considered eligible if you 1) are 18 years of age or older, 2) speak English, 3) have the desire to participate in data collection, and 4) have an Android smartphone with data plan. You are not eligible to participate if 1) you have severe cognitive, hearing, visual, or mobility impairment that would impact your ability to complete study procedures. We will collect data from 20 individuals in this study.<br>

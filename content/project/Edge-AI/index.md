summary: The stringent constrained resources available on tiny sensor nodes
  introduce a number of challenges regarding accuracy, power-efficiency,
  user-comfort, and security. These design considerations, however, often impose
  conflicting requirements. Thus, a comprehensive research approach to design
  future medical embedded systems and corresponding optimizations at different
  levels must consider these interdependent and conflicting requirements. We
  research methods of optimizing medical embedded systems for power-efficiency
  while taking into account other performance metrics. The goal is to develop
  tools, methodologies, and algorithms towards comprehensive approaches to
  address cross-layer optimization issues related to power, performance,
  user-comfort, and security.

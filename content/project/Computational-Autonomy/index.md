summary: Computational algorithms need to be reconfigured (i.e., retrained) upon
  any changes in configuration of wearable technologies, such as
  addition/removal of a sensor to/from the network,
  displacement/misplacement/mis-orientation of the sensors, etc. Re-training of
  these algorithms requires collecting sufficient amount of labeled training
  data, a time consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive process that has been
  identified as a major barrier to personalized and precision medicine. In this
  project, we investigate development of multi-view learning algorithms that
  enable the vision of computationally autonomous and result in highly
  sustainable and scalable wearables of the future.

We envision that wearables of the future must be computationally autonomous in the sense that their underlying computational algorithms reconfigure automatically without need for collecting any new labeled training data. In this project, we investigate development of multi-view learning algorithms that enable the vision of computationally autonomous wearables and result in highly sustainable and scalable wearables of the future. The algorithms and tools are validated through both in-lab experiments and using data collected in uncontrolled environments.

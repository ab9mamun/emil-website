summary: Stress and challenges associated with stress management are prevalent problems of modern life. Many physical and mental health problems are driven by or escalate with the degree of stress. Stress has harmful effects on those who suffer from mental and physical health problems. Therefore a comprehensive study of stress and its effect is an important research topic in the mobile health domain. Our research lies at the intersection of sensor systems and machine learning, in which we research methods of detecting stress in real-life settings. We use wearable sensor systems to capture bio-markers of stress and design and develop machine learning algorithms for stress detection and classification. Our research aims to develop tools, methodologies, and algorithms for comprehensive approaches to stress detection and to invent smart interventions strategies to promote the well-being of individuals.

## About Me
I am a Ph.D. student at Arizona State University currently working for Dr. Hassan Ghasemzadehas as a Graduate Research Associate at Embedded Machine Intelligence Lab (EMIL).

My topic for research is on applications of artifical intelligence in healthcare, specifically it's use in providing prompt care to those in urgent need.

## About Me
I am a Ph.D. student at Arizona State University. I work as a Graduate Research Associate at Embedded Machine Intelligence Lab (EMIL) under the supervision of Dr. Hassan Ghasemzadeh.

My main research focus is on causal inference and counterfactual reasoning. I am working on applying machine learning solutions to "What If" problems. Prior to joining EMIL, I was a master's student at the University of Tehran, where I worked on machine learning applications in cyber-physical systems.

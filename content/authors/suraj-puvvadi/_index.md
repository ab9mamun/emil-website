## About Me

I am an undergraduate student at Arizona State University studying biomedical informatics. Under [Dr. Hassan Ghasemzadeh's](https://search.asu.edu/profile/4018242) supervision and [Shovito Barua Soumma's](https://ghasemzadeh.com/authors/shovito-barua-soumma/) mentorship, I'm designing a large language model to explain time-series data. My research interests include digital health solutions and decision support systems.

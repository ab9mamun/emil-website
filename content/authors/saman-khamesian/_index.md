## About Me

I commenced my journey as a Computer Science Ph.D. student at Arizona State University (ASU) in Spring 2024. Currently, my academic endeavors are guided by Dr. Hassan Ghasemzadeh at the Embedded Machine Learning Lab, where we are immersed in a collaborative project with industry. Our objective is to develop machine learning algorithms capable of processing multimedia patient data to predict post-delivery complications.

Before my doctoral studies, I pursued a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Shahid Beheshti University (SBU). During this time, I gained practical experience as a Machine Learning Engineer at Mofid Securities, contributing to the field for a rewarding two-year period.

My research focus revolves around the design of machine learning models, particularly in the realms of image processing and healthcare solutions applications. I am enthusiastic about leveraging my academic and professional background to contribute meaningfully to the intersection of technology and healthcare in my ongoing academic journey.

## About Me

I am a Ph.D. researcher at Arizona State University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence with a focus on health applications. As a Graduate Research Assistant in the EMIL Lab under Dr. Hassan Ghasemzadeh, I work on developing advanced machine learning solutions for Type 1 diabetes management, including personalized glucose forecasting and automated insulin delivery systems. My academic journey includes earning a master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence and a bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran.

Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Mofid Securities, where I developed financial prediction models, built stock recommendation systems, and implemented spoof detection solutions for eKYC services. With over five years of experience in Python programming, machine learning, and data science, I have a proven track record of solving complex, real-world problems through innovative AI solutions.

I am passionate about interdisciplinary research that bridges academic innovation with impactful applications, particularly in healthcare and finance. Currently, I am also collaborating with researchers at the University of Texas at Austin on projects involving reinforcement learning and behavior change for health improvement.

## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Biomedical Informatics and Data Science at Arizona State University, where I am also pursuing a concurrent M.S. in Computer Science. Previously I earned an M.S. in Biomedical Informatics and Data Science from the same institution. Currently I am working as a Graduate Research Associate at Embedded Machine Intelligence Lab (EMIL) under the supervision of Dr. Hassan Ghasemzadeh. I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET) in 2022. 

My research topics include explainable AI, digital Health, health monitoring system development, optimizing deep learning models for time-series data and human behavior modeling, with an emphasis on label-efficient and power-aware systems for disease monitoring and clinical decision support. 

My works have been published in BSN'25, BHI'25, AAAI'25, EMBC'25, Sensors Journal, and I have multiple journal and conference submissions under review. Visit my website at [shovitobarua.com](https://www.shovitobarua.com/).

## About Me
I am a Ph.D. student at Arizona State University. I work as a Graduate Research Associate at Embedded Machine Intelligence Lab (EMIL) under the supervision of Dr. Hassan Ghasemzadeh. Visit my website at [abdullah-mamun.com](https://abdullah-mamun.com).

Currently, my work includes building and optimizing deep learning models for time-series data. My works have been published in EMBC'22, BSN'22, and BSN'23 conferences and I have multiple journal and confernce submissions under review. I also actively peer-review conference and journal submissions.

I am conducting a user study at ASU where we collect activity and stress data for machine learning algorithm design. If you are willing to participate, visit [here](https://ghasemzadeh.com/cps).

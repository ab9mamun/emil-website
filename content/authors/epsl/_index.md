# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: The current focus of our research in the Embedded Machine Intelligence Lab (EMIL) is on design, development, and validation of algorithms, tools, and technologies that enhance utilization and large-scale adoption of medical embedded systems.  To validate and refine the new technology, we conduct clinical studies involving patients with heart failure, diabetes, cancer, visual impairment, and gait difficulties. Clinical studies are conducted in collaboration with partners from Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine, College of Nursing, College of Pharmacy, College of Education, and College of Agricultural, Human, and Natural Resource Science at WSU as well as our collaborators at Pullman Regional Hospital, UCLA School of Medicine, UCLA Stein Eye Institute, UC-Irvine Nursing Science, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). This end-to-end approach results in innovative, evidence-based and cost-conscious solutions for patients, doctors and medical centers.

Medical embedded systems seamlessly connect human users to the physical world that is richly and invisibly interwoven with sensors, actuators, displays, and networks embedded in the everyday objects. The pervasive nature of such systems will transform the way people interact with each other and their environment and will revolutionize the way next generation medical services are provided. When realized properly, the resulting unparalleled information extracted from these systems enables emerging applications in mobile and remote healthcare, wellness, emergency response, fitness monitoring, elderly care support, long-term preventive chronic care, smart environments, gaming and sports.

The current focus of our research is on design, development, and validation of algorithms, tools, and technologies that enhance utilization and large-scale adoption of sensor-based systems in the real-world. To validate and refine the new technology, we conduct clinical studies involving individuals with or at risk for heart failure, diabetes, cancer, visual impairment, Parkinson's, and cognitive impairment. Studies are conducted in close collaboration with clinical partners. This end-to-end approach results in innovative, evidence-based and cost-conscious solutions for patients, doctors and medical centers.

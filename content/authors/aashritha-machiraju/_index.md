## About Me

I am an accelerated master's student at Arizona State University (ASU) in Computer Science, with a concentration in Biomedical Informatics. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from ASU, where I also pursued a certificate in Computational Life Sciences. Currently, I am pursuing my thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Hassan Ghasemzadeh](https://search.asu.edu/profile/4018242), focusing on Multi-Modal AI for Glucose Prediction in Non-Diabetic Populations. My research interests include machine learning, biomedical informatics, multi-modal AI, and the development of predictive models for healthcare applications.

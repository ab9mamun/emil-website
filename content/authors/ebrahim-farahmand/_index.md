## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the College of Health Solutions, Arizona State University (ASU). Currently, I am working under the supervision of Dr. Hassan Ghasemzadeh at the Embedded Machine Intelligence Lab (EMIL). I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman (SBUK). My research interests include brain-inspired computing,  machine learning, smart health, Body Sensor Networks, energy-efficient systems design, approximate computing, FPGAs, MPSoCs, and embedded systems.

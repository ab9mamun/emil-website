title: "Bayesian Optimization"
abstract: "Bayesian optimization is a powerful approach to hyperparameter tuning and optimization in machine learning, particularly effective for complex functions with unknown gradients and high evaluation costs. Unlike traditional methods like grid or random search, which often lack efficiency, Bayesian optimization combines probabilistic modeling and acquisition functions to balance exploration and exploitation, directing the search towards promising regions. This presentation explores the fundamentals of Bayesian optimization, highlighting its core components: the probabilistic model and the acquisition function. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate Bayesian optimizationâ€™s applicability in tackling optimization challenges, offering an efficient strategy to minimize costly evaluations and identify optimal solutions."
summary: "Bayesian optimization provides a solution to finding optimal parameters efficiently, especially when dealing with functions where traditional gradient-based methods are infeasible. This technique begins with a probabilistic model (Gaussian process) that represents our uncertainty about the function. As data points are sampled, this model is updated, gradually refining our understanding. The acquisition function then guides the search, balancing between exploring uncertain regions and exploiting known promising areas. This structured, adaptive search enables efficient navigation through high-dimensional spaces, even when some variables are discrete or conditional. Key acquisition functions, such as the upper confidence bound and probability of improvement, are discussed to illustrate how Bayesian optimization outperforms simpler search strategies by integrating prior knowledge and sequential learning."

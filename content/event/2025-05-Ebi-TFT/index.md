title: "Temporal Fusion Transformers for interpretable multi-horizon time series forecasting"
abstract: "Multi-horizon forecasting often contains a complex mix of inputs – including static (i.e. time-invariant) covariates, known future inputs, and other exogenous time series that are only observed in the past – without any prior information on how they interact with the target. Several deep learning methods have been proposed, but they are typically ‘black-box’ models that do not shed light on how they use the full range of inputs present in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) – a novel attention-based architecture that combines high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at different scales, TFT uses recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for long-term dependencies. TFT utilizes specialized components to select relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in a wide range of scenarios. On a variety of real-world datasets, we demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks, and highlight three practical interpretability use cases of TFT."
summary: "The paper introduces the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), a novel attention-based deep learning architecture designed for interpretable multi-horizon time series forecasting that effectively handles a mix of static, known future, and observed past inputs. TFT combines gating mechanisms, variable selection networks, and interpretable attention layers to achieve state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while offering insights into feature importance, temporal patterns, and regime changes."

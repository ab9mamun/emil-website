title: "Capacitated Set Cover Problem"
abstract: "We study a variant of the classical set cover problem motivated by conference scheduling, in which each item (e.g., a paper) must be covered exactly once by an eligible agent (e.g., an author) under individual capacity constraints. Formally, given a universe of items and a collection of subsets (each corresponding to items an agent can cover), the goal is to assign each item to exactly one subset, such that no subset covers more than 
ùëö
m items and the total number of subsets used is minimized. We refer to this as the Capacitated Set Cover Problem with Exact Coverage. We present a formal integer linear programming formulation for the problem and discuss its relationship to known combinatorial optimization problems."

summary: "The Capacitated Set Cover Problem with Exact Coverage involves selecting a minimal number of agents to cover all items such that:
 Each item is covered by exactly one agent who is eligible (i.e., included in their subset), 
No agent covers more than m items (capacity constraint)."

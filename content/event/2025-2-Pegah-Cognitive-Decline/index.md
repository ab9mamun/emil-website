As the global population ages, early detection of cognitive decline becomes increasingly critical. This presentation explores the integration of machine learning techniques with longitudinal health data to improve early screening for cognitive impairment. We focus on identifying subtle patterns in behavioral, physiological, and cognitive test data, demonstrating how data-driven models can support clinical decision-making and promote proactive care.

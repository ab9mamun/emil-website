summary: PPO and SAC Algorithms
abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning in which agents learn by interacting with an environment. It includes a variety of algorithms, one category of which is policy-based algorithms. In this section, we will take a closer look at two methods from this category which are PPO and SAC algorithms.

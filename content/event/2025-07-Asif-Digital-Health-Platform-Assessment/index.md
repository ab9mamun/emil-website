summary: This paper runs a 48-week long clinical trial with Type 2 diabetic patients to assess the effectiveness of a digital health platform .
abstract: We investigated the efficacy of an integrated digital health care platform with artificial intelligence (AI)â€“based dietary management in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this 48-week, open-label, randomized, multicenter clinical trial, overweight or obese adults with T2D were randomly assigned to one of three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio- group A received routine diabetes care; group B used the digital integrated health care platform by themselves; and group C used the platform with feedback from medical staff and intermittently applied personal continuous glucose monitoring. The primary end point was the difference of change in HbA1c from baseline to 24 weeks between groups A and B, while secondary end points included changes in HbA1c from baseline to 48 weeks and changes in body weight during follow-up.

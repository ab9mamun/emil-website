This presentation introduces RETFound, a large-scale foundation model developed using self-supervised learning on over 1.6 million retinal images. RETFound is capable of detecting a wide range of ocular and systemic diseases with minimal labeled data. It outperforms traditional supervised models in diagnosing conditions like diabetic retinopathy and predicting cardiovascular and neurodegenerative risks such as heart failure and Parkinsonâ€™s disease. RETFound marks a major advancement toward scalable and generalizable medical AI in ophthalmology and beyond.

title: "Pilot Stress Detection Through Physiological Signals Using a Transformer-Based Deep Learning Model"

abstract: "Pilot stress detection is a challenging task and it plays a vital role in improving flight performance and avoiding catastrophic accidents. Many deep learning models have been adopted for stress recognition. However, these models tend to ignore the dependencies between multimodal physiological signals, which can boost the model performance potentially. A transformer-based deep learning framework, which can obtain the position information of multimodal signals by combining a transformer network with a traditional convolutional neural network (CNN), is proposed for detecting pilot stress. The 14 pilots’ physiological data, including electrocardiography (ECG), electromyography (EMG), electrodermal (EDA), respiration (RESP), and skin temperature (SKT), under different stress states are collected for training and validation, and evaluated among different state-of-the-art models. The results show that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 93.28%, 88.75%, and 84.85% for two-, three-, and four-class classification tasks, respectively, showing faster integration and promising performance."

summary: "This study addresses the challenge of detecting pilot stress, which is crucial for enhancing flight safety and performance. It introduces a transformer-based deep learning framework that integrates a transformer network with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to better capture dependencies and positional information across multimodal physiological signals. Data from 14 pilots—including ECG, EMG, EDA, respiration, and skin temperature—were collected under varying stress levels to train and validate the model against other state-of-the-art approaches."

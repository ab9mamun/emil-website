summary: "The presentation introduces scoping reviews as a structured approach for mapping broad or poorly defined research fields, emphasizing their role in identifying key concepts, methods, data sources, and knowledge gaps rather than evaluating study quality. It explains how scoping reviews differ from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and narrative reviews, and outlines when and why they are most useful, particularly in early-stage research. The presentation details common tools and workflows, including literature databases, reference managers such as Zotero, screening platforms like Rayyan, and reporting guidelines such as PRISMA-ScR. A concrete example is provided through a scoping review on wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for COVID-19, describing search strategies, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and preliminary findings. Early results highlight heterogeneity in wastewater data collection, normalization methods, modeling scales, and evaluation practices, alongside a lack of large-scale, multi-region generalization studies. The talk concludes with practical challenges and key takeaways, underscoring the high time investment but substantial value of scoping reviews for clarifying research directions and justifying future studies."
abstract: "This presentation provides an overview of scoping reviews as a methodological framework for synthesizing knowledge in broad, complex, or emerging research areas. Scoping reviews follow a systematic and reproducible process to map existing evidence, identify dominant concepts, data sources, and methodological trends, and highlight gaps requiring further investigation. Unlike systematic reviews or meta-analyses, scoping reviews prioritize breadth over depth and do not aim to assess study quality or draw conclusions about effectiveness. The presentation outlines motivations for conducting scoping reviews, appropriate use cases, and practical tools for literature search, reference management, screening, and reporting, including PRISMA-ScR guidelines. An applied example focusing on wastewater-based epidemiology for COVID-19 illustrates the full workflow, from database search and screening criteria to preliminary synthesis of findings. Results reveal substantial variability in wastewater measurements, normalization strategies, modeling scales, and a scarcity of cross-region generalization studies. Overall, the presentation demonstrates how scoping reviews support early-stage research by clarifying field boundaries, avoiding redundancy, and providing an evidence-based rationale for new research directions."

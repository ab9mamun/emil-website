summary: Neural networks have a bad reputations as they are treated like black boxes and lack interpretations on the results they make. Grad-CAM can slightly interprete what is driving the model to make a decision. 
abstract: This presentation is all about producing visual explanation heat-maps that will help us understand how deep learning algorithms make decisions. Weâ€™ll see you how to interpret a dataset of cat & dog images using Grad-CAM and we can easily extend this example and use it for univariate and multivariate timeseries problems.

title: "HealthFlow: A Self-Evolving AI Agent for Autonomous Healthcare Research via Meta-Level Strategic Learning"
abstract: "The rapid growth of biomedical literature and electronic health record (EHR) data presents a critical challenge: transforming vast, unstructured information into actionable scientific insight. Existing AI agent frameworks rely on static, human-designed strategies, limiting their ability to adapt to complex and evolving healthcare research workflows. This paper introduces HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that learns to refine its high-level problem-solving strategies through experience. HealthFlow employs a multi-agent architecture with meta-planning, execution, evaluation, and reflection components, enabling the agent to distill successes and failures into structured procedural knowledge that continuously improves future planning. To rigorously evaluate autonomous healthcare research capabilities, we also introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark consisting of complex, evidence-grounded research tasks derived from peer-reviewed scientific literature. Extensive experiments across multiple healthcare agent benchmarks demonstrate that HealthFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent frameworks in task success, robustness, and efficiency. These results highlight the importance of meta-level strategic learning and establish HealthFlow as a step toward more autonomous and effective AI systems for healthcare research."
summary: "This paper presents HealthFlow, a novel AI agent framework designed to autonomously conduct complex healthcare research tasks. Unlike prior agent systems that rely on fixed workflows or component-level optimization, HealthFlow introduces meta-level strategic evolution, allowing the agent to learn how to plan, adapt, and manage research processes over time. HealthFlow operates through a collaborative multi-agent architecture consisting of a meta agent (strategic planner), executor agent (code and tool execution), evaluator agent (short-term correction), and reflector agent (long-term knowledge synthesis). Successful task executions are transformed into structured experiences—such as heuristics, workflow patterns, and warnings—which are stored in a persistent memory and reused to improve future planning.To evaluate this capability, the authors introduce EHRFlowBench, a benchmark of realistic healthcare research workflows mined from peer-reviewed literature. Experimental results across EHRFlowBench and additional medical agent benchmarks show that HealthFlow consistently outperforms existing general and biomedical agent frameworks, particularly on open-ended EHR analysis and modeling tasks. The study demonstrates that enabling agents to evolve their own high-level strategies is critical for advancing autonomous AI systems in healthcare research."

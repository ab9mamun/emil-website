abstract: Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is a method of in situ data
  collection for assessment of behaviors, states, and contexts. Questions are
  prompted during everyday life using an individual’s mobile device, thereby
  reducing recall bias and increasing validity over other self-report methods
  such as retrospective recall. We describe a microinteraction-based EMA method
  (“micro” EMA, or μEMA) using smartwatches, where all EMA questions can be
  answered with a quick glance and a tap – nearly as quickly as checking the
  time on a watch. A between-subjects, 4-week pilot study was conducted where
  μEMA on a smartwatch (n=19) was compared with EMA on a phone (n=14). Despite
  an ≈8 times increase in the number of interruptions, μEMA had a significantly
  higher compliance rate, completion rate, and first prompt response rate, and
  μEMA was perceived as less distracting. The temporal density of data
  collection possible with μEMA could prove useful in ubiquitous computing
  studies.

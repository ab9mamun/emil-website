title: "Efficient Causal Discovery Using Large Language Models"
abstract: "We propose a novel framework that leverages LLMs for full causal graph discovery. While previous LLM-based methods have used a pairwise query approach, this requires a quadratic number of queries which quickly becomes impractical for larger causal graphs. In contrast, the proposed framework uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach which allows it to use only a linear number of queries. We also show that the proposed method can easily incorporate observational data when available, to improve performance. In addition to being more time and data- efficient, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on real-world causal graphs of varying sizes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in discovering causal relationships, showcasing its potential for broad applicability in causal graph discovery tasks across different domains."

summary: "This paper proposes an efficient method for full causal graph discovery using large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior pairwise approaches that require O(n^2) queries, the authors use a breadth-first search (BFS)-based framework that reduces query complexity to O(n) by querying one node at a time. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on small and large graphs, even without access to observational data."

summary: "The presentation reviews a one-year real-world study on a digital twin intervention for managing Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). The study involved 1,853 participants and used continuous glucose monitors, fitness trackers, smart scales, and an app-based digital twin system. The intervention targeted nutritional guidance while tracking sleep, stress, and activity. The program followed three phases: food restriction, reintroduction, and AI-guided normal diet. Results showed a 1.8% average HbA1c reduction, 83% of participants reversed their diabetic status, and over 58% discontinued medication like Metformin. Participants also lost an average of 10 pounds, demonstrating the digital twinâ€™s potential for scalable, non-pharmaceutical T2D management."
abstract: "This presentation examines a retrospective, real-world study evaluating the effectiveness of a digital twin intervention for individuals with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Conducted over one year with 1,853 participants, the intervention utilized a combination of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), fitness tracking devices, smart scales, and a mobile app to deliver AI-guided nutritional strategies. The program was structured into three phases: a 90-day restricted diet, a 90-day reintroduction phase, and a 185-day AI-guided normal diet. Primary outcome measures included HbA1c reduction, medication use, and weight loss. The average participant experienced a 1.8% drop in HbA1c, with 83% falling below the diabetic threshold and more than half discontinuing diabetes medications. Weight loss averaged 10 pounds. These findings support the viability of digital twins in chronic disease management and provide a foundation for future research integrating behavioral dimensions like sleep, stress, and activity into similar intervention models."

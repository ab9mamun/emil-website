title: "Self-Supervised Adversarial Distribution Regularization for Medication Recommendation"
abstract: "Medication recommendation is a significant healthcare application due to its promise in effectively prescribing medications. Avoiding fatal side effects related to Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) is among the critical challenges. Most existing methods try to mitigate the problem by providing models with extra DDI knowledge, making models complicated. While treating all patients with different DDI properties as a single cohort would put forward strict requirements on models' generalization performance. In pursuit of a valuable model for a safe recommendation, we propose the Self-Supervised Adversarial Regularization Model for Medication Recommendation (SARMR). SARMR obtains the target distribution associated with safe medication combinations from raw patient records for adversarial regularization. In this way, the model can shape distributions of patient representations to achieve DDI reduction. To obtain accurate self-supervision information, SARMR models interactions between physicians and patients by building a key-value memory neural network and carrying out multi-hop reading to obtain contextual information for patient representations. SARMR outperforms all baseline methods in the experiment on a real-world clinical dataset. This model can achieve DDI reduction when considering the different number of DDI types, which demonstrates the robustness of adversarial regularization for safe medication recommendation."
summary: "This paper reduces drug-drug interaction in automated medication recommendation with help of self-supervised adversarial distribution regularization"

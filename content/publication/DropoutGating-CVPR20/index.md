title: Dropout as an Implicit Gating Mechanism For Continual Learning
abstract: In recent years, neural networks have demonstrated an outstanding
  ability to achieve complex learning tasks across various domains. However,
  they suffer from the ''catastrophic forgetting'' problem when they face a
  sequence of learning tasks, where they forget the old ones as they learn new
  tasks. This problem is also highly related to the ''stability-plasticity
  dilemma''. The more plastic the network, the easier it can learn new tasks,
  but the faster it also forgets previous ones. Conversely, a stable network
  cannot learn new tasks as fast as a very plastic network. However, it is more
  reliable to preserve the knowledge it has learned from the previous tasks.
  Several solutions have been proposed to overcome the forgetting problem by
  making the neural network parameters more stable, and some of them have
  mentioned the significance of dropout in continual learning. However, their
  relationship has not been sufficiently studied yet. In this paper, we
  investigate this relationship and show that a stable network with dropout
  learns a gating mechanism such that for different tasks, different paths of
  the network are active. Our experiments show that the stability achieved by
  this implicit gating plays a very critical role in leading to performance
  comparable to or better than other involved continual learning algorithms to
  overcome catastrophic forgetting.

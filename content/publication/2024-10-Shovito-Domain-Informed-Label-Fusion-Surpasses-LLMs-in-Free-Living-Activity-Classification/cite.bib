By integrating BERT-based word embeddings with domain-specific knowledge (i.e., MET values), FuSE-MET optimizes label merging, reducing label complexity and improving classification accuracy. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques, including ChatGPT-4, by balancing semantic meaning and physical intensity.}, number={28}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Soumma, Shovito Barua and Mamun, Abdullah and Ghasemzadeh, Hassan}, year={2025}, month={Apr.}, pages={29495-29497} }

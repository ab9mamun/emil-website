abstract: "FUSE-MET addresses critical challenges in deploying human activity recognition (HAR) systems in uncontrolled environments by effectively managing noisy labels, sparse data, and undefined activity vocabularies. By integrating BERT-based word embeddings with domain-specific knowledge (i.e., MET values), FUSE-MET optimizes label merging, reducing label complexity and improving classification accuracy. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques, including ChatGPT-4, by balancing semantic meaning and physical intensity."

abstract: With the proliferation of wearable devices in the Internet-of-Things
  applications, designing highly power-efficient solutions for continuous
  operation of these technologies in life-critical settings emerges. We propose
  a novel ultra-low power framework for adaptive compressed sensing in activity
  recognition. The proposed design uses a coarse-grained activity recognition
  module to adaptively tune the compressed sensing module for minimized
  sensing/transmission costs. We pose an optimization problem to minimize
  activity-specific sensing rates and introduce a polynomial time approximation
  algorithm using a novel heuristic dynamic optimization tree. Our evaluations
  on real-world data shows that the proposed autonomous framework is capable of
  generating feedback with -80% confidence and improves power reduction
  performance of the state-of-the-art approach by a factor of two.

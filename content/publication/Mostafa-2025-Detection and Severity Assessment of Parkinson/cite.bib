ABSTRACT = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second-most common neurodegenerative disease. With more than 20,000 new diagnosed cases each year, PD affects millions of individuals worldwide and is most prevalent in the elderly population. The current clinical methods for the diagnosis and severity assessment of PD rely on the visual and physical examination of subjects and identifying key disease motor signs and symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability. In the present study, we developed a method for the diagnosis and severity assessment of PD using Gramian Angular Fields (GAFs) in combination with deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our model was applied to PD gait signals captured using pressure sensors embedded into insoles. Our results indicated an accuracy of 98.6%, a true positive rate (TPR) of 99.2%, and a true negative rate (TNR) of 98.5%, showcasing superior classification performance for PD diagnosis compared to the methods used in recent studies in the literature. The estimation of disease severity scores using gait signals showed a high accuracy for the Hoehn and Yahr score as well as the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test score (R2 > 0.8), while we achieved a lower prediction performance for the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and its motor component (UPDRSM) scores (R2 < 0.2). These results were achieved using gait signals recorded in time windows as small as 10 s, which may pave the way for shorter, more accessible assessment tools for diagnosis and severity assessment of PD.},

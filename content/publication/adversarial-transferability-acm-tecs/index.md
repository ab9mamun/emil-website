title: "Adversarial Transferability in Embedded Sensor Systems: An Activity Recognition Perspective"
abstract: "In this work, we take the first stride in studying adversarial transferability in wearable sensor systems from four viewpoints: (1) transferability between machine learning models; (2) transferability across subjects of the embedded system; (3) transferability across sensor body locations; and (4) transferability across datasets used for model training."

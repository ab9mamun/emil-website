abstract: "This study developed a novel patient-independent, cost-effective AI model for detecting Freezing of Gait (FoG), using a single wearable sensor and without the need for model retraining in new patients. This approach is expected to reduce patient burden and enhance clinical adoption of the technology. Using a single accelerometer and a rigorous validation methodology, we address individual variability in gait and demonstrate model’s generalizability through cross-validation methods."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Our patient-independent model achieved an overall accuracy of 78% in detecting FoG events using both medication ‘On’ and ‘Off’ state data."

title: "Efficient Sensing and Classification for Extended Battery Life"
abstract: "We propose a resource-efficient, real-time human
activity recognition framework, transforming the multi-class classification problem
into a hierarchical model based on the Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET), creating 
a personalized structure for each individual."

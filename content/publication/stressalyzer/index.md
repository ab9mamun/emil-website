abstract: "Stress detection and monitoring is an active area
of research with important implications for an individualâ€™s
personal, professional, and social health. Current approaches
for stress classification use traditional machine learning al-
gorithms trained on features computed from multiple sensor
modalities. These methods are data and computation-intensive,
rely on hand-crafted features, and lack reproducibility. These
limitations impede the practical use of stress detection and
classification systems in the real world. To overcome these short-
comings, we propose Stressalyzer, a novel stress classification
and personalization framework from single-modality sensor
data without feature computation and selection. Stressalyzer
uses only Electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor data while
providing competitive results compared to the state-of-the-
art techniques that use traditional machine learning models.
Our single-channel neural network-based model achieves a
classification accuracy of 92.9% and an f 1 score of 0.89 for
binary stress classification. Our leave-one-subject-out analysis
establishes the subjective nature of stress and shows that
personalizing stress models using Stressalyzer significantly im-
proves the model performance. Without model personalization,
we found a performance decline in 40% of the subjects,
suggesting the need for model personalization."
